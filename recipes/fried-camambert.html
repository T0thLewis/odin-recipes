            <li>Sunflower oil for frying</li>
            <li>128g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>60ml milk</li>
            <li>128g bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 can whole berry cranberry sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Freeze Camembert cheese for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F
                (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Pour flour into a bowl. Beat eggs and milk together in a separate
                bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a third bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Remove cheese from the freezer and cut each round into 6 wedges.
                Roll each wedge in flour and dip into the egg-milk mixture.
                Press each wedge into bread crumbs until evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>Fry each breaded wedge in the hot oil until bread crumbs are
                browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer fried cheese to a paper
                towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. Serve cranberry sauce on
                the side.
            </li>
